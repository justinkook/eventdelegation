The following code should add a new button with a unique number every time the more button is clicked and render 'Make More Buttons'. It also renders the number of the new buttons when one of them is clicked.

When you have succeeded, pressing the 1 button, should render '1' to the page. Pressing the 2 button, should render '2' to the page, and so on.

Read the commented code carefully and make sure you understand the application before you begin.
